# Study Technique Feature - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-12

## Overview
Implemented database schema for the study technique feature that allows managing study techniques composed of prefix, tech, and suffix components, with support for technique combinations linked to studynames and individual studies.

## Database Schema Created

### Lookup Tables (Component Types)
1. **med.technique_prefix** - Stores prefix options (e.g., "axial", "coronal", "sagittal", "3D", "intracranial", "neck", "")
   - Fields: id, prefix_text (unique), display_order, created_at
   - Empty string ("") represents blank/no prefix

2. **med.technique_tech** - Stores tech options (e.g., "T1", "T2", "GRE", "SWI", "DWI", "CE-T1", "TOF-MRA", "CE-MRA", "3T")
   - Fields: id, tech_text (unique), display_order, created_at
   - Required component (NOT NULL in technique table)

3. **med.technique_suffix** - Stores suffix options (e.g., "of sellar fossa", "")
   - Fields: id, suffix_text (unique), display_order, created_at
   - Empty string ("") represents blank/no suffix

### Composite Tables
4. **med.technique** - Individual technique combining prefix + tech + suffix
   - Fields: id, prefix_id (nullable FK), tech_id (required FK), suffix_id (nullable FK), created_at
   - Unique constraint on (prefix_id, tech_id, suffix_id)
   - Example: "axial T1", "T2 of sellar fossa", "3D TOF-MRA"

5. **med.technique_combination** - Collection of multiple techniques
   - Fields: id, combination_name (nullable), created_at
   - Example name: "Brain MRI Standard Protocol"

6. **med.technique_combination_item** - Join table linking combinations to techniques
   - Fields: id, combination_id (FK), technique_id (FK), sequence_order, created_at
   - Unique constraint on (combination_id, technique_id, sequence_order)
   - Supports ordering for display (e.g., "axial T1 + axial T2 + coronal T2")

### Link Tables
7. **med.rad_studyname_technique_combination** - Links studynames to technique combinations (many-to-many)
   - Fields: id, studyname_id (FK), combination_id (FK), is_default (bool), created_at
   - Unique constraint on (studyname_id, combination_id)
   - Zero or one default combination per studyname

8. **med.rad_study_technique_combination** - Links individual studies to technique combinations (zero-or-one)
   - Fields: id, study_id (FK unique), combination_id (FK), created_at
   - Unique constraint on study_id
   - Study has zero rows if: (a) studyname has no default, OR (b) study matches studyname default
   - Study has one row if: study technique differs from studyname default

### Views
1. **med.v_technique_display** - Formatted display of individual techniques
   - Shows "prefix tech suffix" with proper spacing and trimming
   - Example output: "axial T1", "T2 of sellar fossa", "3D TOF-MRA"

2. **med.v_technique_combination_display** - Formatted display of technique combinations
   - Shows all techniques joined with " + " separator in sequence order
   - Example output: "axial T1 + axial T2 + coronal T2 + sagittal T1 of sellar fossa"
   - Includes technique_count for quick reference

### Indexes Created
- technique.idx_technique_tech_id (btree on tech_id)
- technique_combination_item.idx_technique_combination_item_combination (btree on combination_id)
- technique_combination_item.idx_technique_combination_item_technique (btree on technique_id)
- rad_studyname_technique_combination.idx_rad_studyname_technique_combination_studyname (btree on studyname_id)
- rad_studyname_technique_combination.idx_rad_studyname_technique_combination_combination (btree on combination_id)

### Foreign Key Constraints
- **CASCADE delete**: studyname and study links (when parent deleted, links deleted)
- **RESTRICT delete**: technique component links (prevents deletion of components in use)

### Seed Data
- **Prefixes**: blank (""), axial, coronal, sagittal, 3D, intracranial, neck
- **Techs**: T1, T2, GRE, SWI, DWI, CE-T1, TOF-MRA, CE-MRA, 3T
- **Suffixes**: blank (""), "of sellar fossa"

## Documentation Updated

### Spec.md
- Added FR-453 through FR-468 documenting functional requirements
- Covers component types, composite techniques, combinations, linking, and display

### Plan.md
- Added change log entry with implementation date
- Documented approach: normalization, composite pattern, many-to-many linking
- Included comprehensive test plan for database operations
- Listed risks and mitigations (performance, NULL handling, validation)

### Tasks.md
- Added T621 through T641 for database schema implementation (all marked complete)
- Added T642 through T646 for future work (repository, service, UI)
- All cumulative as per template requirements

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Empty String vs NULL**: Prefix and suffix use empty string ("") to represent blank, not NULL
   - Rationale: Simplifies querying and display logic
   - Documented in table comments

2. **Component Normalization**: Separate lookup tables for prefix, tech, suffix
   - Rationale: Allows reuse, consistent ordering, easy maintenance
   - Trade-off: More joins, but better data integrity

3. **Zero-or-One Study Link**: Studies only store technique_combination when it differs from studyname default
   - Rationale: Reduces redundant data, defaults to studyname
   - Application logic must handle NULL case

4. **Sequence Order**: technique_combination_item includes sequence_order for display
   - Rationale: Techniques have meaningful order (e.g., "axial T1" before "axial T2")
   - Unique constraint includes sequence_order to allow duplicates with different positions

5. **Views for Display**: Created materialized display logic in views
   - Rationale: Consistent formatting, reduces application logic
   - Performance: Indexed properly for efficient queries

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Repository Layer**: Implement CRUD operations for technique components
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic for technique management and validation
3. **UI**: Management interface for creating/editing techniques and combinations
4. **Studyname Linking**: UI for assigning technique combinations to studynames
5. **Study Override**: UI for setting custom technique for individual studies
6. **Validation**: Enforce one default per studyname in application layer
7. **Display Integration**: Show techniques in report headers and study lists

## Testing Recommendations

1. Insert various technique combinations and verify unique constraints
2. Test CASCADE delete by removing studyname and verifying links deleted
3. Test RESTRICT delete by attempting to remove tech in use
4. Query views and verify formatting matches specification
5. Performance test joins with large datasets
6. Test edge cases: all-blank components, multiple defaults per studyname
