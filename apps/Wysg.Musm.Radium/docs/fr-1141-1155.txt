## Update: Global Hotkey for Toggle Sync Text (2025-01-19)
- FR-1141 Settings ¡æ Keyboard tab MUST include a new global hotkey textbox labeled "Toggle sync text:" for configuring the text sync toggle hotkey.
- FR-1142 The textbox MUST use the same PreviewKeyDown handler as other hotkey textboxes to capture key combinations.
- FR-1143 Key combination format MUST support Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Win modifiers plus a single key (e.g., "Ctrl+Alt+T").
- FR-1144 The hotkey value MUST be persisted to `IRadiumLocalSettings.GlobalHotkeyToggleSyncText`.
- FR-1145 MainWindow MUST register the global hotkey (system-wide) using Win32 RegisterHotKey API after window handle is created.
- FR-1146 MainWindow MUST use hotkey ID `0xB002` (HOTKEY_ID_TOGGLE_SYNC_TEXT) to distinguish from other hotkeys.
- FR-1147 When the registered hotkey is pressed system-wide, MainWindow MUST toggle `MainViewModel.TextSyncEnabled` property.
- FR-1148 Hotkey toggle MUST work regardless of whether MainWindow has focus or which application is in foreground.
- FR-1149 The hotkey handler MUST toggle the property value: `vm.TextSyncEnabled = !vm.TextSyncEnabled`.
- FR-1150 Debug logging MUST display the new sync state after toggle (e.g., "[Hotkey] ToggleSyncText executed - new state: True").
- FR-1151 MainWindow MUST unregister the hotkey on window close using UnregisterHotKey API to avoid leaking system-wide registration.
- FR-1152 Hotkey registration MUST occur in OnSourceInitialized after window handle is created (not in OnLoaded or constructor).
- FR-1153 If hotkey registration fails (e.g., key already in use), system MUST log debug message with registration status and continue without error.
- FR-1154 Hotkey parsing MUST use the same TryParseHotkey method as Open Study hotkey for consistency.
- FR-1155 Settings ¡æ Keyboard tab tooltip MUST indicate the new hotkey field supports Ctrl/Alt/Win + key combinations.

**Rationale**: Provides keyboard-first workflow for power users; complements existing global hotkeys (Open Study, Send Study); enables seamless toggling without interrupting work in external editor; follows established hotkey patterns in Radium.
