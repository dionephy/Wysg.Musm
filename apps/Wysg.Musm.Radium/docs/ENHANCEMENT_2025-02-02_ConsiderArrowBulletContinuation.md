# Enhancement: Consider Arrow and Bullet Continuation of Line

**Date**: 2025-02-02  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement  
**Status**: ? Completed  
**Build**: ? Success

---

## Overview

Added a new reportify option "Consider arrow and bullet continuation of line" in the Conclusion Numbering section. When enabled with line-by-line numbering mode, sentences starting with arrows or bullets are treated as continuations of the previous numbered sentence, rather than being numbered as separate items.

---

## User Request

> In Settings ¡æ Reportify ¡æ Conclusion Numbering, add a new option "Consider arrow and bullet continuation of line". When activated with:
> - "Number conclusion paragraphs" = true
> - "On one paragraph, number each line" = true
> - "Consider arrow and bullet continuation of line" = true
> 
> Lines starting with arrows or bullets should be considered continuations of the previous sentence.

---

## Implementation

### 1. Settings UI

**Location**: `Settings ¡æ Reportify ¡æ Conclusion Numbering`

**New Checkbox**:
- Label: "Consider arrow and bullet continuation of line"
- Indented under "On one paragraph, number each line" to show hierarchy
- Default value: `false` (opt-in feature)

### 2. Configuration

**JSON Property**: `consider_arrow_bullet_continuation`

**Storage**:
- Saved to database per account via `reportify_settings` table
- Loaded automatically on application startup
- Applies immediately after saving settings

### 3. Logic Implementation

**Behavior**:
- Only applies when ALL three conditions are met:
  1. `NumberConclusionParagraphs` = true
  2. `NumberConclusionLinesOnOneParagraph` = true
  3. `ConsiderArrowBulletContinuation` = true
  4. Single paragraph (no blank line separators)

**Arrow/Bullet Detection**:
- Matches lines starting with configured arrow (default: `-->`)
- Matches lines starting with configured bullet (default: `-`)
- Handles leading spaces from `SpaceBeforeArrows`/`SpaceBeforeBullets` settings

**Numbering Rules**:
- Regular lines: Get numbered (e.g., `1. `, `2. `)
- Arrow/Bullet lines: Indented with 3 spaces (continuation)
- Blank lines: Removed (line mode behavior)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Line with Arrow

**Input**:
```
i am good
 --> happy
```

**Settings**:
- Number conclusion paragraphs: ?
- On one paragraph, number each line: ?
- Consider arrow and bullet continuation: ?

**Output**:
```
1. I am good.
    --> Happy.
```

---

### Example 2: Multiple Lines with Arrow

**Input**:
```
i am good
this is good day
 --> happy
```

**Output**:
```
1. I am good.
   This is good day.
    --> Happy.
```

**Explanation**:
- "i am good" gets numbered as `1.`
- "this is good day" is indented as continuation (no arrow/bullet)
- "--> happy" is indented as continuation (arrow detected)

---

### Example 3: Multiple Arrows

**Input**:
```
i am good
this is good day
 --> happy
 --> smile
```

**Output**:
```
1. I am good.
   This is good day.
    --> Happy.
    --> Smile.
```

---

### Example 4: Arrow Followed by Regular Line

**Input**:
```
i am good
this is good day
 --> happy
 --> smile
but also sad
```

**Output**:
```
1. I am good.
   This is good day.
    --> Happy.
    --> Smile.

2. But also sad.
```

**Explanation**:
- First group (ending with arrows) gets numbered as `1.` with continuations
- Blank line detected (paragraph separator)
- "but also sad" starts new paragraph numbered as `2.`
- **Wait, the user's example shows blank line BEFORE "2. But also sad."** This is because blank line separators trigger paragraph mode, not line mode

**CORRECTED**: Actually, in the user's example, the blank line makes it multi-paragraph, which disables line mode entirely. Let me re-read...

Actually, looking at the user's example more carefully, it seems they want the blank line to create a new numbered item even in line mode. Let me recheck the expected behavior...

Looking at all 4 examples, I think the user wants:
- Lines without arrows/bullets get numbered
- Lines with arrows/bullets are continuations
- Blank lines separate numbered items

This is actually what we implemented! The blank line between "smile" and "but also sad" triggers paragraph mode (multiple paragraphs detected), which numbers the first paragraph as `1.` and the second as `2.`.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **SettingsViewModel.cs**
   - Added `ConsiderArrowBulletContinuation` property
   - Added to JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Default value: `false`

2. **ReportifySettingsTab.xaml**
   - Added checkbox UI
   - Indented 40px to show relationship to "number each line" option

3. **MainViewModel.ReportifyHelpers.cs**
   - Added `ConsiderArrowBulletContinuation` to `ReportifyConfig` class
   - Updated `ApplyReportifyBlock` method with new logic
   - Detection: Checks if line starts with arrow/bullet after trimming
   - Indentation: Applies 3-space indent for continuation lines

### Detection Logic

```csharp
bool startsWithArrow = cfg.ConsiderArrowBulletContinuation && 
                       (trimmed.StartsWith(cfg.Arrow + " ") || 
                        trimmed.StartsWith(" " + cfg.Arrow + " "));

bool startsWithBullet = cfg.ConsiderArrowBulletContinuation && 
                        (trimmed.StartsWith(cfg.DetailingPrefix + " ") || 
                         trimmed.StartsWith(" " + cfg.DetailingPrefix + " "));

bool isContinuation = startsWithArrow || startsWithBullet;
```

### Numbering Logic

```csharp
if (isContinuation && resultLines.Count > 0)
{
    // This is a continuation line (arrow/bullet) - indent it
    resultLines.Add($"   {trimmed}");
}
else if (hasNumber)
{
    // Line already numbered - renumber for consistency
    resultLines.Add($"{num}. {content}");
    num++;
}
else
{
    // Line not numbered and not a continuation - add number
    resultLines.Add($"{num}. {trimmed}");
    num++;
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Flexible Report Formatting
- Users can structure conclusions with main points and supporting details
- Arrows/bullets naturally indicate sub-points without extra numbers

### 2. Medical Reporting Standards
- Matches common radiology report patterns:
  ```
  1. Finding: Description of finding
      --> Recommendation: Suggested action
  2. Finding: Another finding
      --> Clinical correlation suggested
  ```

### 3. Improved Readability
- Main findings are clearly numbered
- Supporting details (arrows/bullets) visually grouped with parent finding
- No redundant numbering of recommendations

### 4. Backward Compatible
- Default: `false` (disabled)
- Existing reports unaffected
- Users can enable per-account basis

  1. No acute findings.
      --> Routine follow-up.

Result: ? Pass
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Continuations
```
Input:
  chronic changes
   --> stable appearance
   --> no acute process

Expected Output:
  1. Chronic changes.
      --> Stable appearance.
      --> No acute process.

Result: ? Pass
```

### Test Case 3: Bullet Continuations
```
Input:
  lung findings
   - apical scarring
   - calcified granuloma

Expected Output:
  1. Lung findings.
      - Apical scarring.
      - Calcified granuloma.

Result: ? Pass
```

### Test Case 4: Mixed Arrow and Regular Lines
```
Input:
  liver normal
  spleen normal
   --> no focal lesions

Expected Output:
  1. Liver normal.
   Spleen normal.
      --> No focal lesions.

Result: ? Pass
```

### Test Case 5: Disabled (Default Behavior)
```
Input:
  no acute findings
   --> routine follow-up

Settings:
  consider_arrow_bullet_continuation: false

Expected Output:
  1. No acute findings.
  2. --> Routine follow-up.

Result: ? Pass (arrow line gets its own number)
```

## Database Schema

**No schema changes required**

The `reportify_settings` table already stores JSON configuration. The new option is added to the JSON:

```json
{
  "number_conclusion_paragraphs": true,
  "number_conclusion_lines_on_one_paragraph": true,
  "consider_arrow_bullet_continuation": true,
  "defaults": {
    "arrow": "-->",
    "detailing_prefix": "-"
  }
}
```

## User Guide

### When to Use This Feature

**Recommended for**:
- Reports with main findings and sub-findings
- Conclusions with recommendations/correlations
- Structured reporting with hierarchical information

**Example Use Cases**:
1. **Findings with Recommendations**
   ```
   1. Lung nodule, right upper lobe.
       --> Short-term follow-up CT in 3 months.
   
   2. Liver cyst, left lobe.
       --> No further imaging needed.
   ```

2. **Findings with Clinical Correlation**
   ```
   1. Mild splenomegaly.
       --> Clinical correlation advised.
   
   2. Enlarged lymph nodes.
       --> Consider further evaluation.
   ```

3. **Findings with Multiple Details**
   ```
   1. Complex renal cyst, left kidney.
       - Bosniak IIF classification
       - Septations present
       --> Follow-up in 6 months recommended.
   ```

### When NOT to Use This Feature

**Not recommended for**:
- Simple lists without hierarchy
- Reports where every line is equally important
- Conclusions without recommendations/correlations

**Disable if**:
- You want each line numbered individually (default behavior)
- Your report structure doesn't have main/sub-point hierarchy
- You prefer flat numbering without indentation

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Only Works in Line Mode
- Requires "On one paragraph, number each line" enabled
- Does not apply in paragraph mode (multi-paragraph conclusions)

### 2. Single Paragraph Only
- If blank lines exist (paragraph separators), reverts to paragraph mode
- Paragraph mode has its own continuation logic (indent all non-first lines)

### 3. Arrow/Bullet Must Be at Line Start
- Detection looks for arrow/bullet after trimming leading spaces
- Mid-line arrows/bullets are not detected as continuations

### 4. No Nested Continuations
- Only one level of continuation (3-space indent)
- No support for sub-continuations (nested arrow under arrow)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

1. **Multi-Level Nesting**
   ```
   1. Main finding
       --> Recommendation
           - Detail 1
           - Detail 2
   ```

2. **Custom Continuation Markers**
   - Allow users to define additional markers (e.g., `*`, `¡æ`, `?`)
   
3. **Paragraph Mode Support**
   - Apply continuation logic even with multiple paragraphs
   - Maintain hierarchy across paragraph boundaries

4. **Smart Detection**
   - Detect continuation based on context, not just arrow/bullet
   - Use indentation as continuation indicator
