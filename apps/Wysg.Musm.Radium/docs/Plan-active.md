## Change Log Addition (2025-01-20 ? SetFocus Operation Retry Logic)

### User Request
In spy window -> Custom Procedures, the "SetFocus" operation works on test run but not working in the procedure module. Add several retries for the "SetFocus" operation.

### Problem
SetFocus operation was failing in procedure module execution due to timing issues where UI elements may not be fully ready when the operation is executed. The operation worked in test mode (with manual delays between steps) but failed during automated procedure execution.

### Root Cause
UI automation elements sometimes need time to become ready for focus operations, especially in complex applications or when elements are being dynamically created/updated. A single attempt without retry was insufficient for reliable execution.

### Solution
Added retry logic with configurable attempts and delays for the SetFocus operation:

**Retry Configuration**:
- **Max Attempts**: 3 attempts
- **Retry Delay**: 150ms between attempts
- **Feedback**: Preview message indicates if multiple attempts were needed

**Implementation**:
- Try SetFocus operation up to 3 times
- Wait 150ms between failed attempts
- Track last exception for error reporting
- Show attempt count in success message if retries were needed
- Show detailed error message after all attempts fail

### Files Modified (2 files)
1. `SpyWindow.Procedures.Exec.cs` - Added retry logic to SetFocus case in ExecuteSingle method
2. `ProcedureExecutor.cs` - Added retry logic to SetFocus case in ExecuteElemental method

### Code Changes

**SpyWindow.Procedures.Exec.cs**:
```csharp
case "SetFocus":
{
    var elFocus = ResolveElement(row.Arg1, vars);
    if (elFocus == null) { preview = "(no element)"; break; }
    
    // Retry logic for SetFocus - sometimes elements need time to be ready
    const int maxAttempts = 3;
    const int retryDelayMs = 150;
    Exception? lastException = null;
    bool success = false;
    preview = "(error)"; // Initialize to default value
    
    for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++)
    {
        try
        {
            elFocus.Focus();
            preview = attempt > 1 ? $"(focused after {attempt} attempts)" : "(focused)";
            success = true;
            break;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            lastException = ex;
            if (attempt < maxAttempts)
            {
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(retryDelayMs);
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (!success)
    {
        preview = $"(error after {maxAttempts} attempts: {lastException?.Message})";
    }
    break;
}
```

**ProcedureExecutor.cs**:
```csharp
case "SetFocus":
{
    var el = ResolveElement(row.Arg1);
    if (el == null) return ("(no element)", null);
    
    // Retry logic for SetFocus - sometimes elements need time to be ready
    const int maxAttempts = 3;
    const int retryDelayMs = 150;
    Exception? lastException = null;
    bool success = false;
    
    for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++)
    {
        try
        {
            el.Focus();
            var preview = attempt > 1 ? $"(focused after {attempt} attempts)" : "(focused)";
            success = true;
            return (preview, null);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            lastException = ex;
            if (attempt < maxAttempts)
            {
                Task.Delay(retryDelayMs).Wait();
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (!success)
    {
        return ($"(error after {maxAttempts} attempts: {lastException?.Message})", null);
    }
    
    return ("(error)", null);
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Improved Reliability**: SetFocus operation now succeeds more consistently in procedure module execution
2. **Diagnostic Feedback**: Users can see when retries were needed, helping identify problematic elements
3. **Error Details**: Clear error messages show what went wrong after all attempts fail
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same retry logic applied in both test mode and procedure execution
5. **Minimal Performance Impact**: Only 300ms maximum delay (2 retries ¡¿ 150ms) on complete failure

### Status
? **Implemented and Tested** - Build successful, ready for production use

### Future Enhancements
- Consider making retry count and delay configurable via settings
- Add retry logic to other timing-sensitive operations (e.g., ClickElement, Invoke)
- Implement exponential backoff for retry delays if needed

## Change Log Addition (2025-01-19 ? Foreign Text Merge Caret Preservation and Focus Management)

> **Archive Note**: Detailed plan available in [archive/2025-Q1/Plan-2025-Q1-foreign-text-sync.md](archive/2025-Q1/Plan-2025-Q1-foreign-text-sync.md)

### User Requests
1. On sync text OFF, preserve caret position: `new_caret = old_caret + foreign_text_length + newline`
2. Prevent foreign textbox from stealing focus when cleared (best-effort)

### Implementation Summary

**Caret Preservation Flow**:
1. TextSyncEnabled setter calculates adjustment: `foreignLength = ForeignText.Length + newline`
2. Merge text and set `FindingsCaretOffsetAdjustment = foreignLength`
3. XAML binding flows adjustment: MainViewModel ¡æ EditorControl ¡æ MusmEditor
4. OnDocumentTextChanged applies adjustment after text update, then resets to 0

**Focus Prevention**:
- WriteToForeignAsync no longer calls SetFocus()
- **Note**: Some apps (Notepad) may still steal focus due to app-specific behavior
- UIA ValuePattern.SetValue() works without focus in most cases

### Files Modified (8 files)
1. `MainViewModel.cs` - Added FindingsCaretOffsetAdjustment property
2. `MusmEditor.cs` - Added CaretOffsetAdjustment DP and adjustment logic
3. `EditorControl.View.cs` - Added CaretOffsetAdjustment DP forwarding
4. `CurrentReportEditorPanel.xaml` - Added binding to EditorFindings
5. `TextSyncService.cs` - Removed SetFocus() call, updated comments
6. Documentation updates (Spec.md, Plan-update-caretsync.md, Tasks.md)

### Status
? **Implemented** - Build successful, all tests passing

## Change Log Addition (2025-01-18 ? Current Combination Quick Delete and All Combinations Library)

### User Requests
1. Double-click items in "Current Combination" to remove them quickly
2. Add ListBox showing all combinations that can be double-clicked to load

### Implementation Summary

**Quick Delete**:
- Added MouseDoubleClick handler to Current Combination ListBox
- Created `RemoveFromCurrentCombination(item)` method
- Updates SaveNewCombinationCommand after removal
- Updated GroupBox header with hint text

**All Combinations Library**:
- Added `AllCombinations` ObservableCollection to ViewModel
- Created `GetAllCombinationsAsync()` in repository
- Query from `v_technique_combination_display` ordered by id DESC
- Double-click loads combination into Current for modification
- Prevents duplicates during load

**Layout Adjustment**:
- Changed left panel from 4 rows to 5 rows
- Both ListBoxes have equal vertical space

### Files Modified (4 files)
1. `StudynameTechniqueViewModel.cs` - Added collections and methods
2. `TechniqueRepository.cs` + `.Pg.Extensions.cs` - Added query methods
3. `StudynameTechniqueWindow.xaml.cs` - Added layout and event handlers

### Status
? **Implemented** - Feature complete and tested

## Change Log Addition (2025-01-18 ? ReportInputsAndJsonPanel Side-by-Side Row Layout)

### User Request
Synchronize Y-coordinates between main textboxes and proofread counterparts dynamically as heights change.

### Problem
Previous column-based layout made alignment impossible without custom behaviors.

### Solution
Restructured to side-by-side row layout where each textbox pair shares the same vertical position naturally via WPF Grid mechanics.

**Height Binding Strategy**:
- Proofread textboxes bind MinHeight to corresponding main textbox MinHeight
- Chief Complaint / Patient History: 60px minimum
- Findings / Conclusion: 100px minimum
- Textboxes grow with content but never shrink below main textbox minimum

**Scroll Synchronization**:
- Added `OnProofreadScrollChanged` event handler
- Uses `_isScrollSyncing` flag to prevent feedback loops
- One-way sync: proofread scroll affects main column

### Files Modified (2 files)
1. `ReportInputsAndJsonPanel.xaml` - Restructured layout with MinHeight bindings
2. `ReportInputsAndJsonPanel.xaml.cs` - Added scroll sync handler

### Status
? **Implemented** - Alignment natural, no custom calculation needed

## Change Log Addition (2025-01-15 ? Phrase-SNOMED Mapping Window UX Enhancements)

### Problems
1. Search textbox empty when window opens (user must retype phrase)
2. Map button stays disabled after selecting concept

### Root Causes
1. `SearchText` property not initialized with phrase text
2. `MapCommand.CanExecuteChanged` not raised when `SelectedConcept` changes

### Fixes
1. **Pre-fill Search**: Set `SearchText = phraseText` in constructor
2. **Enable Map Button**: Replace `[ObservableProperty]` with manual property setter calling `MapCommand.NotifyCanExecuteChanged()`

### Files Modified (1 file)
1. `PhraseSnomedLinkWindowViewModel.cs` - Constructor init + manual property

### Status
? **Implemented** - UX improvements deployed
