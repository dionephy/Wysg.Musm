# Radium Implementation Plan

## Current iteration
- [x] PP1: Tree uses ResolvePath for exact parity with crawl editor; adds desktop-wide first-node fallback; still chain to level 4 then expand children.
- [x] PP2: Stable operation presets and editor switching.

## Next
- [ ] Settings UI for depths.
- [ ] Improve first-node fallback ranking if multiple matches are present.
