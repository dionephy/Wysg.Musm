## Smart Text Appending

The feature intelligently handles text appending:

- **Empty target field**: Copied text is inserted directly
- **Non-empty target field**: A newline is added before the copied text
- **Multiple copies**: Each copy adds a new line for readability

**Example**:
```
Chief Complaint (before): "Patient complains of chest pain"
Copy from Study Remark: "Radiating to left arm"
Chief Complaint (after): 
    Patient complains of chest pain
    Radiating to left arm
```

### ? DON'T:
