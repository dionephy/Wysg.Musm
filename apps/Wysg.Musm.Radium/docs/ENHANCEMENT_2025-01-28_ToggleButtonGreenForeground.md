# Enhancement: Toggle Button Active State Visual Feedback

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Type**: UI/UX Enhancement  
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: ? Implemented

---

## Overview

Enhanced the visual feedback for toggle buttons by making the text color slightly green when the toggle is in the active (checked) state.

---

## Problem Statement

Toggle buttons in the application (Proofread, Splitted, Reportified, etc.) currently show their active state through:
- Darker background color
- Blue border color

However, the text color remains unchanged, which can make it less immediately obvious which toggles are active, especially when multiple toggles are present.

---

## Proposed Solution

Add a subtle green tint to the toggle button text when the button is checked/active, providing an additional visual cue for the active state.

---

## Implementation Approach

1. Add a new color resource for active toggle state
2. Modify the `DarkToggleButtonStyle` to apply green foreground when `IsChecked="True"`
3. Maintain existing background and border color changes

---

## Color Selection

**Chosen Color**: `#90EE90` (Light Green)

**Rationale**:
- Light enough to maintain good readability on dark background
- Green is universally associated with "active" or "on" states
- Subtle enough to not clash with existing dark theme
- Provides sufficient contrast ratio for accessibility

---

## Visual Design

### Active Toggle Appearance
- Background: Dark gray (#3C3C3C)
- Border: Blue (#2F65C8)
- Text: **Light green (#90EE90)** ก็ NEW

### Inactive Toggle Appearance
- Background: Medium gray (#2D2D30)
- Border: Gray (#3C3C3C)
- Text: Light gray (#D0D0D0)

---

## Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Active toggles are easier to spot at a glance
2. **Better UX**: Triple visual cues (background + border + text color)
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with common UI patterns for active states
4. **Accessibility**: Multiple visual indicators help users with different visual preferences
5. **Theme Consistency**: Green color complements the existing dark theme

---

## User Impact

**Affected Users**: All users of the Radium application

**User-Visible Changes**:
- Toggle button text turns light green when active
- No functional changes - purely visual enhancement

**Migration Required**: None

---

## Technical Scope

**Files Modified**: 
- `apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/Themes/DarkTheme.xaml`

**Components Affected**:
- All toggle buttons using `DarkToggleButtonStyle`

---

## Testing Notes

- Verify color appears correctly on different displays
- Ensure text remains readable in all states
- Check that hover and disabled states still work correctly

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add smooth color transition animation
- Make toggle active color configurable in settings
- Apply similar treatment to other toggleable UI elements
