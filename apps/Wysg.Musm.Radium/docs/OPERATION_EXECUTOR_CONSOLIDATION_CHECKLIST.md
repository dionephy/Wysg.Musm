## Testing Checklist

### Automated Testing ?

- [x] **Build verification**
  - [x] Solution builds without errors
  - [x] All projects compile successfully
  - [x] No breaking changes to public APIs

### Manual Testing Required ??

**SpyWindow (UI Testing Context)**
- [ ] Open SpyWindow
- [ ] Create test procedure with GetHTML operation
- [ ] Target Korean website (e.g., naver.com)
- [ ] Execute procedure step
- [ ] Verify Korean text displays correctly (not ?????)
- [ ] Test other operations (Split, Replace, ClickElement, etc.)
- [ ] Verify element caching (GetSelectedElement ¡æ ClickElement)

**ProcedureExecutor (Background Automation)**
- [ ] Create procedure with GetHTML in JSON file
- [ ] Run ProcedureExecutor.ExecuteAsync("YourMethodTag")
- [ ] Verify GetHTML returns Korean text correctly
- [ ] Test automation sequences end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all MainViewModel operations (GetCurrentPatientNumber, etc.)

**Encoding Detection Testing**
- [ ] Test URL with UTF-8 encoding
- [ ] Test URL with CP949 encoding
- [ ] Test URL with EUC-KR encoding
- [ ] Test URL with mixed UTF-8/CP949
- [ ] Test URL with mojibake (Latin-1 misinterpreted as UTF-8)
- [ ] Verify encoding detection logs in Debug output

**Operation Coverage Testing**
Test all 30+ operations in both contexts:
- [ ] String operations (8)
- [ ] Element operations (11)
- [ ] System operations (6)
- [ ] MainViewModel operations (5)
- [ ] HTTP operations (1)

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (Documented)

1. **Async operations** 
   - GetHTML/GetTextOCR use `.Result` in sync contexts
   - Future: Make ProcedureExecutor.ExecuteAsync truly async
   - Impact: May block thread during HTTP calls

2. **UI thread dependencies**
   - MainViewModel operations require Dispatcher.Invoke
   - SetFocus requires UI thread for window activation
   - Clipboard operations need STA thread
   - Impact: Operations may fail if Dispatcher unavailable

3. **Element caching**
   - Each caller manages own cache (SpyWindow instance, ProcedureExecutor static)
   - No automatic cache invalidation
   - Staleness detection only in ProcedureExecutor
   - Impact: Stale elements may cause errors

### Build Warnings (Acceptable)

- Warning CS0219/CS0168 in OperationExecutor (unused variables in switch default)
  - **Status**: Acceptable - variables declared but switch handles all cases
  - **Action**: No fix needed - code clarity maintained

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during runtime testing:

### Option 1: Quick Fix
1. Fix specific operation in OperationExecutor.cs
2. Both SpyWindow and ProcedureExecutor benefit immediately
3. No code duplication to maintain

### Option 2: Rollback (Worst Case)
1. Restore SpyWindow.Procedures.Http.cs from git history
2. Restore SpyWindow.Procedures.Encoding.cs from git history
3. Restore original SpyWindow.Procedures.Exec.cs ExecuteSingle implementation
4. Restore original ProcedureExecutor.Operations.cs ExecuteRow implementation
5. Remove OperationExecutor.cs

**Git Commands:**
```bash
# View deleted files
git log --diff-filter=D --summary

# Restore specific file
git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file-path>

# Example
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/Views/SpyWindow.Procedures.Http.cs
```

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Blocking) ?
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] All operations implemented in OperationExecutor
- [x] SpyWindow delegates correctly
- [x] ProcedureExecutor delegates correctly
- [x] Documentation complete

### Should Have (Critical) ??
- [ ] GetHTML works with Korean encoding in SpyWindow
- [ ] GetHTML works with Korean encoding in ProcedureExecutor
- [ ] All 30+ operations tested in SpyWindow
- [ ] All 30+ operations tested in ProcedureExecutor

### Nice to Have (Enhancement)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (before/after)
- [ ] Unit tests for OperationExecutor
- [ ] Integration tests for encoding detection
- [ ] Telemetry for operation success rates
