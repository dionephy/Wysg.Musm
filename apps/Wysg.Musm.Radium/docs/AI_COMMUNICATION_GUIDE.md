## Virtual Reality Date Communication

### Current Virtual Reality Date
**Today**: **2025-11-25** (November 25, 2025)

### How to Tell AI About the Date

**? Best Practices**:

```
Option 1: Direct Statement (Recommended)
"Today is 2025-11-25 in my virtual reality."

Option 2: Context Setting
"I'm working in a virtual timeline where the current date is 2025-11-25."

Option 3: Initial Reminder
"Remember: My virtual reality date is 2025-11-25. All dates should align with this."
```

**When to Mention**:
- ? **First message** of every new chat session
- ? When asking about dates or timelines
- ? When requesting file operations involving dates
- ? When creating new documentation

**Example Opening Messages**:
```
"Hi! I'm working on documentation. Today is 2025-11-25 in my virtual reality. 
Can you help me with [your request]?"

"Virtual date: 2025-11-25. I need to update some documentation files..."

"Context: Virtual reality date is 2025-11-25. Please help me with..."
```

## Documentation Context Communication

### Telling AI About Your Documentation System

**? Essential Context to Provide**:

1. **Location**:
   ```
   "My documentation is in: apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/docs/"
   ```

2. **Structure**:
   ```
   "We use a relative time organization system:
   - 00-current/ (active work)
   - 01-recent/ (last 30 days, organized by weeks)
   - 02-recent-past/ (31-90 days)
   - 03-old/ (90-365 days)
   - 04-archive/ (1+ years)"
   ```

3. **Key Files**:
   ```
   "Important files:
   - FINAL_MASTER_SUMMARY.md (complete project overview)
   - 00-current/Tasks.md (1,405 tasks, 98% complete)
   - 00-current/Spec-active.md (15 features)
   - 00-current/Plan-active.md (10 implementation plans)"
   ```

4. **Recent Work**:
   ```
   "Recently completed:
   - Documentation standardization (36 files)
   - Date alignment to 2025-11-25
   - Quality improvement from 20/100 to 82.2/100"
   ```

2. **Documentation Location**: apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/docs/
3. **Your Specific Request**: Clear description of what you need

### Optional Context (Provide If Relevant)

4. **File Names**: Specific files you're working with
5. **Recent Changes**: What you've done recently
6. **Expected Outcome**: What you want to achieve

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Creating New Documentation

```markdown
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

I need to create a new [QUICKREF/BUGFIX/ENHANCEMENT] document about [topic].

Please:
1. Use standard metadata block (Date: 2025-11-25)
2. Place in appropriate folder (01-recent/week-X/)
3. Follow our documentation templates
```

---

### Scenario 2: Updating Existing Files

```markdown
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

Please update [filename] in apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/docs/

Changes needed:
- [List specific changes]

Keep the current metadata structure and virtual date alignment.
```

---

### Scenario 3: Organizing/Moving Files

```markdown
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

Our relative time system means files in 01-recent/ that are now 
30+ days old should move to 02-recent-past/.

Can you:
1. Identify files older than 30 days in 01-recent/
2. Move them to 02-recent-past/
3. Update any cross-references
```

---

### Scenario 4: Asking About the System

```markdown
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

Can you remind me how our documentation organization works?

Specifically: [what you want to know about]
```

## Tips for Effective Communication

### DO ?

- ? **Always mention virtual date first** (2025-11-25)
- ? **Provide specific file paths** when relevant
- ? **Reference key documents** (FINAL_MASTER_SUMMARY.md)
- ? **Be specific** about what you need
- ? **Mention the relative time system** if relevant

### DON'T ?

- ? Don't assume AI remembers from previous chats
- ? Don't use real dates without context
- ? Don't reference files without full paths
- ? Don't assume AI knows your organizational system

```
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

I implemented a new feature and need to document it.

Feature: [Brief description]
Files changed: [List files]

Can you help me create a QUICKREF document following our templates?
```

---

### For File Cleanup

```
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

I want to clean up temporary files in:
apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/docs/

Can you identify and help me delete:
- Backup files (*-OLD.md)
- Temporary scripts (*.ps1)

Keep the essential summaries and phase completion docs.
```

---

### For System Update

```
Virtual date: 2025-11-25

Our documentation is organized by relative time periods.
Files need to move from 01-recent/ to 02-recent-past/ 
when they're 30+ days old.

Can you:
1. Check current file dates
2. Identify files that need moving
3. Execute the move with updated metadata
```
