# Enhancement: Previous Report Selector - Automatic Population

**Date**: 2025-02-02  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: Medium

---

## Overview

When a previous study is selected via tab in `PreviousReportEditorPanel.xaml`, the report selector ComboBox (`cboPrevReport`) is automatically populated with all available reports for that study, with the most recent report selected by default.

---

## Problem Statement

**Before:**
- The report selector ComboBox had a dummy item and used a `CompositeCollection` approach
- Reports were not automatically populated when switching between previous study tabs
- Users could not easily see and select different versions of reports for the same study
- The most recent report was not automatically selected

**Issue:**
- Users needed to manually manage report selection
- No visual indication of available report versions
- Inconsistent with user expectations for multi-report handling

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. XAML Binding Update (`PreviousReportEditorPanel.xaml`)

**Before:**
```xaml
<ComboBox Grid.Row="1" 
          x:Name="cboPrevReport" 
          Margin="0,1,0,0" 
          HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" 
          HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch"
          SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedPreviousStudy.SelectedReport, Mode=TwoWay}" 
          MinWidth="200">
    <ComboBox.ItemsSource>
        <CompositeCollection>
            <ComboBoxItem Content="Dummy Studyname (2025-01-01 09:00:00) - 2025-01-02 10:11:12 by Radiologist X"/>
            <cc:CollectionContainer Collection="{Binding SelectedPreviousStudy.Reports}"/>
        </CompositeCollection>
    </ComboBox.ItemsSource>
</ComboBox>
```

**After:**
```xaml
<ComboBox Grid.Row="1" 
          x:Name="cboPrevReport" 
          Margin="0,1,0,0" 
          HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" 
          HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch"
          ItemsSource="{Binding SelectedPreviousStudy.Reports}"
          SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedPreviousStudy.SelectedReport, Mode=TwoWay}" 
          MinWidth="200">
</ComboBox>
```

**Changes:**
- Removed `CompositeCollection` and dummy item
- Direct binding to `SelectedPreviousStudy.Reports`
- Cleaner, more maintainable XAML
- Proper two-way binding for report selection

#### 2. Data Model (Already Implemented)

The `PreviousStudyTab` class already has the necessary structure:

```csharp
public sealed class PreviousStudyTab : BaseViewModel
{
    public ObservableCollection<PreviousReportChoice> Reports { get; } = new();
    
    private PreviousReportChoice? _selectedReport;
    public PreviousReportChoice? SelectedReport 
    { 
        get => _selectedReport; 
        set 
        { 
            if (SetProperty(ref _selectedReport, value)) 
            { 
                Debug.WriteLine($"[PrevTab] Report selection changed"); 
                ApplyReportSelection(value); 
            } 
        } 
    }
    
    public void ApplyReportSelection(PreviousReportChoice? rep)
    {
        if (rep == null) return;
        OriginalFindings = rep.Findings;
        OriginalConclusion = rep.Conclusion;
        Findings = rep.Findings;
        Conclusion = rep.Conclusion;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Report Loading (Already Implemented)

The `LoadPreviousStudiesForPatientAsync` method already:
- Orders reports by `ReportDateTime DESC` (most recent first)
- Populates the `Reports` collection for each tab
- Sets the first report as default:

```csharp
foreach (var row in g.OrderByDescending(r => r.ReportDateTime))
{
    // ... create PreviousReportChoice and add to tab.Reports
}
tab.SelectedReport = tab.Reports.FirstOrDefault(); // Most recent report
```

#### 4. Display Format (Already Implemented)

`PreviousReportChoice` has a `Display` property for ComboBox formatting:

```csharp
public sealed class PreviousReportChoice : BaseViewModel
{
    public DateTime? ReportDateTime { get; set; }
    public string CreatedBy { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Studyname { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    
    public string Display => $"{Studyname} ({StudyDateTimeFmt}) - {ReportDateTimeFmt} by {CreatedBy}";
    
    private string StudyDateTimeFmt => _studyDateTime?.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") ?? "?";
    private string ReportDateTimeFmt => ReportDateTime?.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") ?? "(no report dt)";
    
    public override string ToString() => Display;
}
```

---

## Behavior

### When User Selects a Previous Study Tab:

1. **Tab Selection** ¡æ `SelectedPreviousStudy` property changes
2. **Report Collection Binding** ¡æ ComboBox `ItemsSource` updates to show all reports for that study
3. **Default Selection** ¡æ Most recent report (first in collection) is automatically selected
4. **Report Application** ¡æ Selected report's findings and conclusion populate the editors
5. **User Can Change** ¡æ User can select different report versions from the ComboBox dropdown

### Report Display Format in ComboBox:

```
MRI Brain (2025-01-15 10:30:00) - 2025-01-15 11:45:00 by Dr. Smith
CT Chest (2025-01-15 10:30:00) - 2025-01-15 12:30:00 by Dr. Jones
CT Chest (2025-01-15 10:30:00) - (no report dt) by Dr. Brown
```

Format: `{Studyname} ({StudyDateTime}) - {ReportDateTime} by {CreatedBy}`

### Report Selection Priority:

1. **Most Recent Report DateTime** ¡æ Automatically selected
2. **Null Report DateTime** ¡æ Appears as "(no report dt)", sorted last
3. **User Override** ¡æ User can manually select any report version

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Single Report Study**
   - Select previous study tab with one report
   - ? ComboBox shows one item
   - ? Report is automatically selected
   - ? Editors populate with report content

2. **Multiple Report Study**
   - Select previous study tab with multiple reports (different report_datetime)
   - ? ComboBox shows all reports ordered by most recent first
   - ? Most recent report is automatically selected
   - ? User can select different report versions
   - ? Editors update when report selection changes

3. **Tab Switching**
   - Switch between different previous study tabs
   - ? ComboBox content updates for each tab
   - ? Each tab remembers its selected report
   - ? No cross-contamination between tabs

4. **Reports Without DateTime**
   - Study with reports having null `report_datetime`
   - ? Displays as "(no report dt)" in ComboBox
   - ? Sorted after reports with valid datetimes
   - ? Still selectable and functional

5. **Empty Reports Collection**
   - Previous study with no reports (edge case)
   - ? ComboBox is empty
   - ? No errors or crashes
   - ? Editors remain empty

## Database Schema Reference

Reports are loaded from the `med.rad_report` table:

```sql
SELECT rs.id, rs.study_datetime, sn.studyname, rr.report_datetime, rr.report
FROM med.rad_study rs
JOIN med.patient p ON p.id = rs.patient_id
JOIN med.rad_studyname sn ON sn.id = rs.studyname_id
JOIN med.rad_report rr ON rr.study_id = rs.id
WHERE p.tenant_id=@tid AND p.patient_number = @num
  AND ((rr.report ->> 'header_and_findings') IS NOT NULL
       OR (rr.report ->> 'final_conclusion') IS NOT NULL
       OR (rr.report ->> 'conclusion') IS NOT NULL)
ORDER BY rs.study_datetime DESC, rr.report_datetime DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**Key Points:**
- Reports are grouped by `study_id` and `study_datetime`
- Each report has a `report_datetime` (can be NULL)
- Reports are ordered by `report_datetime DESC` (most recent first)
- Multiple reports can exist for the same study (e.g., preliminary, final, addendum)

3. **No Filtering** - Shows all reports regardless of status or type
4. **No Sorting Options** - Fixed sort by report_datetime DESC

---

## Conclusion

This enhancement provides a seamless experience for working with multiple report versions for previous studies. The automatic population and default selection reduce clicks and improve workflow efficiency while maintaining code quality through proper XAML binding patterns.

The implementation leverages existing data structures and ViewModels, requiring only a minimal XAML change to remove the dummy item placeholder and establish proper binding. The feature integrates smoothly with existing proofread and splitted modes, providing a complete solution for previous report management.
