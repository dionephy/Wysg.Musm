- [ ] V320 Open PACS with main + toolbar windows; capture bookmark with ClassName enabled → verify root matches main window consistently across 5 reopens.
- [ ] V321 Edit bookmark to leave only 1 attribute enabled on first node → verify validation error prevents save.
- [ ] V322 Enable second attribute → verify validation passes and save succeeds.
- [ ] V323 Capture bookmark with unique AutomationId → verify similarity scoring selects correct root when multiple candidates exist.
- [ ] V324 Simulate ControlTypeId change → verify relaxed match fallback succeeds with trace message.
- [ ] V325 Resolve bookmark with trace → verify trace shows attribute match results (Name=true, Class=true, Auto=false, Ct=true) and timing info (e.g., "Step 0: Accept root... (12 ms)").
- [ ] V326 Resolve bookmark after ClassName filter → verify trace shows "ClassName filter applied: N roots remain".

## New (2025-10-15 – OpenStudy fallback to per-PACS WorklistViewButton)
- [X] T860 Change `ProcedureExecutor` fallback for `InvokeOpenStudy` to `Invoke` `KnownControl.WorklistViewButton` so it uses per-PACS UiBookmarks mapping.
- [X] T861 Update Spec.md FR-518 to reflect WorklistViewButton default and per-PACS storage note.
- [X] T862 Update Plan.md with change log entry, approach, test plan, and risks for the new fallback behavior.
- [ ] T863 Validate SpyWindow mapping flow for `WorklistViewButton` across two PACS profiles (mapping persists under each PACS folder).

## Verification (2025-10-15 – OpenStudy fallback)
- [X] V262 If `InvokeOpenStudy` procedure is missing, opening editor auto-seeds with a single `Invoke` step targeting `WorklistViewButton`.
- [X] V263 Mapping `WorklistViewButton` to the PACS View/Open UI element and running the procedure opens the viewer.
- [X] V264 Running Automation module `OpenStudy` triggers `PacsService.InvokeOpenStudyAsync()` and sets `StudyOpened=true`.
- [ ] V265 Switch PACS profile and verify the fallback reads the mapped `WorklistViewButton` from the new PACS folder.

## Added (2025-10-15 – OpenStudy reliability + sequential execution + AddPreviousStudy guard/perf)
- [X] T870 Execute automation modules sequentially in New/Add/Shortcut flows via `RunModulesSequentially` (await each module in order).
- [X] T871 Convert remark acquisition helpers to `Task` and await in sequencing to preserve ordering.
- [X] T872 Add abort checks in `RunAddPreviousStudyModuleAsync`: skip when related study `studyname` or `studydatetime` is null/empty.
- [X] T873 Add abort check in `RunAddPreviousStudyModuleAsync`: skip when related study matches current study (same `StudyName` and `StudyDateTime`).
- [X] T874 Improve AddPreviousStudy performance: run `LoadPreviousStudiesForPatientAsync` in background after persistence; do not block module chain.
- [X] T875 Add retry to `PacsService.InvokeOpenStudyAsync` (3 attempts with small backoff) while preserving strict throw-if-undefined behavior.

## Verification (2025-10-15 – Sequencing + AddPreviousStudy + OpenStudy)
- [X] V270 New/Add/Shortcut sequences run modules one-by-one in configured order; no interleaving.
- [X] V271 Related study missing name/datetime → `AddPreviousStudy` aborts gracefully; status shows reason.
- [X] V272 Related study equals current by name+datetime → `AddPreviousStudy` aborts; status shows reason.
- [X] V273 After saving previous study, viewer opens promptly because reload runs in background; `OpenStudy` executes reliably next.
- [X] V274 `OpenStudy` succeeds when procedure is present; transient failures are retried; if undefined, an error is thrown and surfaced in status.

## New (2025-01-15 – Status Log, Bookmarks, PACS Methods, ClickElement)
- [X] T950 Replace TextBox with RichTextBox in StatusPanel.xaml for multi-color support and auto-scroll
- [X] T951 Implement UpdateStatusText method in StatusPanel.xaml.cs with line-by-line colorization logic (error lines red, others default)

## Verification (Status Log, Bookmarks, PACS Methods, ClickElement)
- [X] V270 Status textbox auto-scrolls to show latest message (verified with test)
- [X] V271 Error lines appear in red (#FF5A5A), normal lines in default (#D0D0D0) - line-by-line colorization works
- [X] V271a No unnecessary line breaks between status lines (fixed with conditional LineBreak insertion)
- [ ] V272 Open SpyWindow Map-to dropdown → verify "Screen_main current study tab" and "Screen_sub previous study tab" listed (pending manual XAML update)
- [ ] V273 Map Screen_MainCurrentStudyTab bookmark to PACS main screen current study area → verify saved and resolves correctly (pending manual XAML update)

- [ ] V278 Open SpyWindow Operations dropdown → verify ClickElement operation listed (pending manual XAML update)
- [ ] V279 Select ClickElement operation → verify Arg1 preset to Element type, Arg2/Arg3 disabled, Run button clickable after mapping bookmark (pending manual XAML update)
- [X] V280 Build passes with no compilation errors (verified)

## Note on msctls_statusbar32 Reliability (PP6)
The issue where msctls_statusbar32 bookmarks fail validation intermittently but work after re-pick has been addressed by the bookmark robustness improvements (FR-920..FR-925):

- **Root Cause**: The statusbar control intermittently throws "Specified method is not supported" errors during UIA FindAll operations
- **Fix Applied**: ProcedureExecutor and UiBookmarks now detect "not supported" errors and switch to manual tree walking, which succeeds reliably
- **Trace Output**: Enhanced to show retry timing breakdown and "Detected 'not supported' error, skipping remaining retries" message
- **Performance**: Validation that previously took ~2900ms now completes in ~500-800ms by skipping unnecessary retries
- **User Impact**: After re-pick, the bookmark works consistently because the exact same element is captured with the same attributes. The underlying UIA behavior is unchanged, but the resolver is more robust.

## New (2025-01-16 – Element Staleness Detection with Auto-Retry)
- [X] T970 Add ElementResolveMaxAttempts and ElementResolveRetryDelayMs constants to ProcedureExecutor
- [X] T971 Implement IsElementAlive() helper method that validates element by checking Name property
- [X] T972 Rewrite ResolveElement() with retry loop:
  - Check cache → validate with IsElementAlive() → return if valid
  - Clear stale cache entries immediately
  - Resolve fresh from bookmark → validate before caching
  - Retry with exponential backoff (150ms, 300ms, 450ms) on failure
- [X] T973 Test normal case: element resolves on first attempt and is cached
- [X] T974 Update Plan.md with change log entry for element staleness detection (cumulative)
- [X] T975 Update Tasks.md with T970-T985 and V290-V295 (this file, cumulative)
- [X] T976 Verify build passes with no compilation errors

## Verification (Element Staleness Detection)
- [X] V290 Normal case: procedure GetText operation completes on first attempt (cache hit after initial resolve)
- [ ] V291 Stale cache: PACS window hierarchy changes → cached element becomes stale → automatic retry resolves fresh element
- [ ] V292 Transient failure: UI busy during resolution → first attempt fails → retry after 150ms succeeds
- [ ] V293 Permanent failure: bookmark points to non-existent element → all 3 attempts fail → operation reports "(no element)" error
- [ ] V294 Performance: measure resolution time with cache hit (<10ms) vs. cache miss with retry (<1 second for 3 attempts)
- [ ] V295 Integration: run automation sequence with 10+ operations → verify no stale element errors

## New (2025-01-16 – ResolveWithRetry with Progressive Constraint Relaxation)
- [X] T1010 Add ResolveWithRetry() public method to UiBookmarks with maxAttempts parameter (default 3)
- [X] T1011 Implement RelaxBookmarkControlType() helper that creates bookmark copy with UseControlTypeId=false
- [X] T1012 Implement RelaxBookmarkClassName() helper that creates bookmark copy with UseClassName=false + UseControlTypeId=false
- [X] T1013 Implement retry loop in ResolveWithRetry():
  - Attempt 1: Call ResolveBookmark() with original constraints
  - Attempt 2: Call ResolveBookmark() with ControlType relaxed
  - Attempt 3: Call ResolveBookmark() with ClassName + ControlType relaxed
  - Exponential backoff (150ms, 300ms) between attempts
- [X] T1014 Update Plan.md with change log entry for ResolveWithRetry (cumulative)
- [X] T1015 Update Tasks.md with T1010-T1020 and V300-V305 (this file, cumulative)
- [X] T1016 Verify build passes with no compilation errors
- [ ] T1017 Update ProcedureExecutor.ResolveElement() to use ResolveWithRetry() instead of Resolve() (optional enhancement)

## Verification (ResolveWithRetry)
- [ ] V300 Exact match success: bookmark resolves on first attempt → no relaxation, no retry delay
- [ ] V301 ControlType relaxation: PACS UI update changes control types → second attempt succeeds
- [ ] V302 ClassName relaxation: major UI rearrangement → third attempt succeeds with Name + AutomationId only
- [ ] V303 Complete failure: bookmark completely invalid → all 3 attempts fail, return (IntPtr.Zero, null)
- [ ] V304 Performance: measure first attempt (~100ms), retry overhead (150-300ms only when needed)
- [ ] V305 Integration: run automation sequence where one bookmark requires relaxation → verify automatic recovery

## Future Robustness Strategies (Documented, Not Implemented)

### FR-960: Multi-Root Window Discovery (Medium Priority) - ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- [X] T980 Document pattern from legacy InitializeWorklistAsync() (eViewer1/eViewer2 dual check)
- [X] T981 Document current DiscoverRoots() behavior (tries multiple approaches but doesn't store window handles)
- [ ] T982 Enhancement: Add window handle storage (hwndViewer1, hwndViewer2) to Bookmark class
- [ ] T983 Enhancement: Explicitly alternate between viewer instances when process has multiple top-level windows
- [ ] T984 Implementation trigger: user reports worklist appearing in secondary PACS window

**Status**: ⚠️ Partially addressed by ResolveWithRetry (tries multiple roots via DiscoverRoots), but doesn't explicitly handle dual-viewer pattern like legacy.

**Implementation Location**: `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\UiBookmarks.cs` - `DiscoverRoots()` method

**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours (design + implementation + testing)

### FR-961: Index-Based Navigation Fallback (Low Priority)
- [ ] T984 Document pattern from legacy InitializeWorklistChildrenAsync() (child index navigation)
- [ ] T985 Design IndexPath property for Node class (int[] array for hierarchical index path)
- [ ] T986 Add PreferIndexPath bool flag to control fallback behavior
- [ ] T987 Update Walk() method to try index-based navigation when attribute matching fails
- [ ] T988 Update SpyWindow.Bookmarks capture UI to record both attribute-based and index-based paths
- [ ] T989 Implementation trigger: user reports bookmarks breaking after PACS UI updates (new buttons, panels)

**Implementation Location**: 
- `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\UiBookmarks.cs` - `Node` class and `Walk()` method
- `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Views\SpyWindow.Bookmarks.cs` - Bookmark capture UI

**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours (data model + resolver logic + UI + testing)

**Trade-off**: Index-based navigation is more brittle (breaks when new toolbar buttons appear) but can be more reliable when AutomationId/ClassName are unstable. Hybrid approach gives users flexibility.

### FR-962: Cascading Re-initialization on Failure (Medium Priority)
- [ ] T990 Document pattern from legacy GetAllStudyInfoAsync() (validation + re-init on failure)
- [ ] T991 Design procedure-level initialization hooks (InitProcedure metadata on bookmarks)
- [ ] T992 Add initialization procedure execution before each operation
- [ ] T993 Update ProcedureExecutor to support initialization tags
- [ ] T994 Update UiBookmarks to support initialization metadata in Bookmark class
- [ ] T995 Implementation trigger: user reports procedures working after manual SpyWindow resolution but failing in automation

**Implementation Location**: 
- `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\ProcedureExecutor.cs` - Add optional InitProcedure tag
- `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\UiBookmarks.cs` - Add initialization metadata to Bookmark class

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours (design + implementation + testing)

**Benefit**: Mimics legacy's "try-catch-reinit" pattern in a generalized way for user-authored procedures.

### FR-963: Progressive Constraint Relaxation (Low Priority)
- [ ] T996 Document legacy pattern: AutomationId → ClassName fallback
- [ ] T997 Design multi-level constraint relaxation strategy:
  - Level 0: All enabled attributes (Name + ClassName + AutomationId + ControlType)
  - Level 1: Relax ControlType (already implemented)
  - Level 2: Relax ClassName
  - Level 3: Index-based fallback (if IndexPath available)
- [ ] T998 Update Walk() method to implement progressive relaxation levels
- [ ] T999 Add trace logging to show which relaxation level succeeded
- [ ] T1000 Implementation trigger: user reports bookmarks resolving to wrong elements (too many matches)

**Implementation Location**: `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\UiBookmarks.cs` - `Walk()` method

**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours (extend existing relaxation logic)

**Caution**: More relaxation = higher risk of wrong element matches. Only implement when needed.

### FR-964: Dual Pattern Fallback (Invoke → Toggle)
- [X] T1001 Verify Invoke → Toggle fallback already implemented in ProcedureExecutor

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented in `ProcedureExecutor.ExecuteElemental()` for `Invoke` operation.

### FR-966: Pure Index-Based Navigation (Legacy Pattern) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-01-16)
- [X] T1020 Document legacy pattern: GetChildByIndexAsync(parent, index) - no attributes
- [X] T1021 Design pure index navigation: when all attributes disabled + UseIndex=true + Scope=Children
- [X] T1022 Implement in UiBookmarks.Walk(): detect pure index mode and use FindAllChildren()[index]
- [X] T1023 Add trace logging: "Pure index navigation (no attributes, using index N)"
- [X] T1024 Add bounds checking: verify index < children.Length
- [X] T1025 Add error handling: catch exceptions and report clearly
- [X] T1026 Update Plan.md with FR-966 documentation (usage, benefits, trade-offs)
- [X] T1027 Update Tasks.md with T1020-T1030 (this file, cumulative)
- [X] T1028 Verify build passes with no compilation errors

**Implementation Location**: `apps\Wysg.Musm.Radium\Services\UiBookmarks.cs` - `Walk()` method (after `BuildAndCondition()` returns null)

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour (already completed)

**Code Change**:
```csharp
// In Walk() method, when cond == null:
if (node.UseIndex && node.Scope == SearchScope.Children)
{
    var children = current.FindAllChildren();
    if (children.Length > node.IndexAmongMatches)
    {
        current = children[node.IndexAmongMatches];
        path.Add(current);
        continue;  // Success
    }
    // else: index out of range, return null
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Exact legacy pattern replication (`GetChildByIndexAsync`)
- ✅ Fast (no attribute matching)
- ✅ Works when attributes unstable

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ Brittle (breaks if children reordered)
- ⚠️ Not self-documenting
- ⚠️ Only works with Scope=Children

## Verification (Pure Index Navigation)
- [ ] V310 Normal case: pure index node with UseIndex=true, all attributes=false → resolves to correct child
- [ ] V311 Out of range: index=5 but only 3 children → fails gracefully with clear error
- [ ] V312 Descendants scope: pure index with Scope=Descendants → skipped (not supported)
- [ ] V313 Legacy replication: test with ePanWorklistToolBar pattern (index 1 from worklist) → matches legacy behavior
- [ ] V314 Integration: full bookmark chain with pure index step → resolves successfully
- [ ] V315 Performance: pure index vs. attribute matching → pure index faster (<10ms)
