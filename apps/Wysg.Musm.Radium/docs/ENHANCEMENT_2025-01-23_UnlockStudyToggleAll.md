# Enhancement: UnlockStudy Module - Toggle Off All Study States

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Issue**: UnlockStudy module only toggled off PatientLocked, leaving StudyOpened and Reportified in ON state  
**Status**: ? Fixed  
**Build**: ? Success

## Problem

The `UnlockStudy` automation module only set `PatientLocked = false`, leaving the `StudyOpened` and `Reportified` toggles in their current state. This caused inconsistent state when unlocking a study, as users would have to manually toggle off these flags.

**Before**:
- `UnlockStudy` module: Only set `PatientLocked = false`
- `StudyOpened` remained ON if it was previously enabled
- `Reportified` remained ON if it was previously enabled

**Example Scenario**:
1. User opens a study (StudyOpened = ON)
2. User enables reportify mode (Reportified = ON)
3. User locks study (PatientLocked = ON)
4. User runs UnlockStudy automation
5. **Result**: PatientLocked = OFF, but StudyOpened = ON, Reportified = ON ?

---

## Solution

Enhanced the `UnlockStudy` module to reset all three study-related toggle states:
- `PatientLocked = false`
- `StudyOpened = false`
- `Reportified = false`

This ensures a clean slate when unlocking, making the unlock operation more predictable and consistent with user expectations.

## Implementation

**File**: `apps/Wysg.Musm.Radium/ViewModels/MainViewModel.Commands.cs`

**Before**:
```csharp
else if (string.Equals(m, "UnlockStudy", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) 
{ 
    PatientLocked = false; 
    SetStatus("Study unlocked"); 
}
```

**After**:
```csharp
else if (string.Equals(m, "UnlockStudy", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) 
{ 
    PatientLocked = false; 
    StudyOpened = false; 
    Reportified = false;
    SetStatus("Study unlocked (all toggles off)"); 
}
```

## Behavior Changes

### Before Enhancement
```
State before UnlockStudy:
- PatientLocked: ON
- StudyOpened: ON
- Reportified: ON

After UnlockStudy module:
- PatientLocked: OFF
- StudyOpened: ON  ¡ç Still ON
- Reportified: ON  ¡ç Still ON
```

### After Enhancement
```
State before UnlockStudy:
- PatientLocked: ON
- StudyOpened: ON
- Reportified: ON

After UnlockStudy module:
- PatientLocked: OFF
- StudyOpened: OFF  ¡ç Now OFF
- Reportified: OFF  ¡ç Now OFF
```

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Send Report Sequence
**Sequence**: `SendReport, UnlockStudy`

**Before**:
- Report sent (may include reportified text)
- Study unlocked (PatientLocked = OFF)
- StudyOpened still ON (inconsistent)
- Reportified still ON (user sees formatted text)

**After**:
- Report sent (raw text, as intended)
- Study unlocked (PatientLocked = OFF)
- StudyOpened now OFF (clean state)
- Reportified now OFF (user sees raw text again)

### 2. Manual Unlock via Automation
**User manually runs UnlockStudy module from settings**

**Before**:
- User had to manually toggle off StudyOpened
- User had to manually toggle off Reportified
- Inconsistent UI state

**After**:
- One module resets all three toggles
- Clean, predictable state
- Single action to reset everything

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Send Report with Reportify
1. Open a study (StudyOpened = ON, PatientLocked = ON)
2. Enable reportify (Reportified = ON)
3. Run SendReport automation with UnlockStudy module
4. **Expected**:
   - Report sent successfully
   - PatientLocked = OFF
   - StudyOpened = OFF
   - Reportified = OFF
   - Status shows "Study unlocked (all toggles off)"

### Test Case 2: Manual Unlock
1. Set all three toggles to ON manually
2. Run automation sequence containing UnlockStudy
3. **Expected**:
   - All three toggles turn OFF
   - Status shows "Study unlocked (all toggles off)"

### Test Case 3: LockStudy/UnlockStudy Cycle
1. Run LockStudy automation (PatientLocked = ON)
2. Run UnlockStudy automation
3. **Expected**:
   - PatientLocked = OFF
   - StudyOpened = OFF (even if it was ON before)
   - Reportified = OFF (even if it was ON before)

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Changes
? **Consistent Unlock Behavior**: UnlockStudy now resets all study-related states  
? **Cleaner State Management**: One module handles all three toggles  
? **Better User Experience**: No need to manually toggle off multiple flags  
? **Predictable Automation**: Unlock always returns to clean slate  
? **Matches User Intent**: "Unlock" implies resetting all study session state

### Potential Concerns
?? **Existing Automation Sequences**: Users may have automation sequences that rely on StudyOpened or Reportified staying ON after unlock
- **Mitigation**: This is unlikely since UnlockStudy typically marks the end of a workflow (e.g., after SendReport)
- **Mitigation**: Users can manually set StudyOpened/Reportified ON again if needed in their sequence

?? **Backward Compatibility**: Existing automation may behave differently
- **Mitigation**: The new behavior is more intuitive and matches the "unlock" semantic
- **Mitigation**: Status message clearly indicates "all toggles off" to inform users

## Related Features

This change complements:
- **LockStudy** module: Sets `PatientLocked = true` (only sets lock, doesn't affect other toggles)
- **OpenStudy** module: Sets `StudyOpened = true`
- **Reportify** module: Sets `Reportified = true`
- **SendReport** automation: Often followed by UnlockStudy to complete workflow

---

## Rationale

The semantic meaning of "unlock" implies returning to an unlocked/unopened/unformatted state. When a study is unlocked:
- It should not be considered "locked" (PatientLocked = false) ?
- It should not be considered "opened" (StudyOpened = false) ?
- It should not be in "reportified" mode (Reportified = false) ?

This matches the typical workflow:
1. **New Study** ¡æ Open ¡æ Lock ¡æ Edit ¡æ Reportify ¡æ Send ¡æ **Unlock** (ready for next study)
2. Unlock should reset everything to prepare for the next study

---

## Status Messages

**Old Message**: `"Study unlocked"`  
**New Message**: `"Study unlocked (all toggles off)"`

The new message explicitly indicates that all toggles are turned off, helping users understand the complete state change.

---

## Summary

**Problem**: UnlockStudy only toggled off PatientLocked  
**Solution**: UnlockStudy now toggles off PatientLocked, StudyOpened, and Reportified  
**Result**: Clean state reset, predictable automation, better user experience  

**Status**: ? Enhanced  
**Build**: ? Success  
**Impact**: Improved consistency and usability
