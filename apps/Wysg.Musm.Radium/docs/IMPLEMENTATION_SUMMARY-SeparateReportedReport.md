# Implementation Summary: Separate Reported Report from Current Editable Report

**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Feature**: FR-1300  
**Status**: ? Implemented (Fixed)  
**Build**: ? Success

---

## Problem

The `header_and_findings` field in `CurrentReportJson` was bound to `FindingsText` (the Findings editor), which meant:
- ? Any user edit would overwrite the original PACS report
- ? Original report data was lost when user typed in the editor
- ? Database saved user's working draft instead of original PACS report
- ? Conflated two different concepts: reported report (from PACS) vs current working draft

**CRITICAL FIX**: Initially, I removed the `findings` and `conclusion` fields entirely, which broke the UI binding. This has been fixed - both sets of fields now coexist.

---

## Solution

Created **dual-field architecture** with TWO separate sets of fields in JSON:

### 1. Reported Report Fields (PACS original, read-only)

```csharp
// Populated ONLY by GetReportedReport - NOT bound to editors
public string ReportedHeaderAndFindings { get; set; }
public string ReportedFinalConclusion { get; set; }
```

**Saved to JSON as**:
- `header_and_findings` (original PACS findings)
- `final_conclusion` (original PACS conclusion)

### 2. Current Editable Report Fields (user's working draft, two-way)

```csharp
// Existing properties - bound to UI editors
public string FindingsText { get; set; }  // EditorFindings
public string ConclusionText { get; set; } // EditorConclusion
```

**Saved to JSON as**:
- `findings` (current editable findings)
- `conclusion` (current editable conclusion)

### Data Flow

```
PACS Report Data (via GetReportedReport)
    ⊿
ReportedHeaderAndFindings  式式⊥  JSON.header_and_findings
ReportedFinalConclusion    式式⊥  JSON.final_conclusion
    ⊿
Database Save (original PACS report preserved)

User Edits (via UI Editors)
    ⊿
FindingsText  式式⊥  JSON.findings  ∠式式  EditorFindings
ConclusionText 式式⊥ JSON.conclusion ∠式式 EditorConclusion
    ⊿
Database Save (current working draft preserved)
```

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "header_and_findings": "Original PACS findings (GetReportedReport)",
  "final_conclusion": "Original PACS conclusion (GetReportedReport)",
  "findings": "Current editable findings (Findings editor)",
  "conclusion": "Current editable conclusion (Conclusion editor)",
  "chief_complaint": "...",
  "patient_history": "...",
  "study_techniques": "...",
  "comparison": "...",
  ...
}
```

## What Changed

### 1. MainViewModel.Editor.cs

**Added**:
- `ReportedHeaderAndFindings` property
- `ReportedFinalConclusion` property

**Updated**:
- `UpdateCurrentReportJson()`: Saves BOTH reported AND current editable fields
  ```csharp
  var obj = new
  {
      // Reported (PACS original)
      header_and_findings = _reportedHeaderAndFindings,
      final_conclusion = _reportedFinalConclusion,
      
      // Current editable (user's draft)
      findings = _reportified ? _rawFindings : FindingsText,
      conclusion = _reportified ? _rawConclusion : ConclusionText,
      ...
  };
  ```

- `ApplyJsonToEditors()`: Loads both sets of fields separately
  ```csharp
  // Load reported fields (not bound to editors)
  _reportedHeaderAndFindings = newHeaderAndFindings;
  _reportedFinalConclusion = newFinalConclusion;
  
  // Load current editable fields (update editors)
  _rawFindings = newFindings;
  _rawConclusion = newConclusion;
  FindingsText = newFindings; // Updates editor
  ConclusionText = newConclusion; // Updates editor
  ```

### 2. MainViewModel.Commands.cs

**Updated**:
- `RunGetReportedReportAsync()`: Sets `ReportedHeaderAndFindings` instead of `FindingsText`
  ```csharp
  // Before (WRONG):
  FindingsText = findings;  // ? Overwrote user's edits
  
  // After (CORRECT):
  ReportedHeaderAndFindings = findings;  // ? Separate field
  // FindingsText unchanged ?
  ```

## Key Benefits

### ? Data Integrity
- Original PACS report NEVER overwritten by user edits
- Clear separation between reported data and working draft
- Audit trail preserved (can always see original report)
- User's working draft preserved independently

### ? Correct Database Storage
- `header_and_findings` = original PACS report (immutable after GetReportedReport)
- `findings` = user's current working draft (mutable, bound to editor)
- Both fields persisted for audit and comparison

### ? No Breaking Changes
- Existing `FindingsText`/`ConclusionText` properties unchanged
- UI editors work exactly as before (two-way binding maintained)
- Automation sequences compatible

## Usage Example

### Automation Sequence

```
1. GetReportedReport
   ⊿
   Sets: ReportedHeaderAndFindings = "No acute intracranial hemorrhage."
   Sets: ReportedFinalConclusion = "Normal study."
   ⊿
   JSON Updated: 
   {
     "header_and_findings": "No acute intracranial hemorrhage.",
     "final_conclusion": "Normal study.",
     "findings": "",  // User hasn't edited yet
     "conclusion": ""
   }

2. User edits Findings editor ⊥ types "unremarkable brain"
   ⊿
   FindingsText = "unremarkable brain"
   ⊿
   JSON Updated:
   {
     "header_and_findings": "No acute intracranial hemorrhage.",  // UNCHANGED ?
     "final_conclusion": "Normal study.",                         // UNCHANGED ?
     "findings": "unremarkable brain",                            // UPDATED ?
     "conclusion": ""
   }

3. SaveCurrentStudyToDB
   ⊿
   Database saves JSON with BOTH:
     - header_and_findings: "No acute intracranial hemorrhage." (original PACS)
     - findings: "unremarkable brain" (user's current edit)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Completed
- [x] New properties created
- [x] JSON serialization saves both reported and current editable fields
- [x] GetReportedReport module updated
- [x] Findings/Conclusion editors still bound and functional
- [x] Build succeeds

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Run GetReportedReport automation
- [ ] Verify JSON has both `header_and_findings` and `findings` fields
- [ ] Edit Findings editor
- [ ] Verify `findings` updates, `header_and_findings` unchanged
- [ ] Save to database
- [ ] Verify database has both fields

## Build Status

- No warnings
- All modified files compiled successfully

---

## Critical Fix Applied

**Issue**: Initially removed `findings` and `conclusion` fields entirely, breaking UI binding.

**Fix**: Restored `findings` and `conclusion` fields for UI editor binding while keeping `header_and_findings` and `final_conclusion` for reported report.

**Result**: 
- ? Both sets of fields now coexist in JSON
- ? Editors bound to `findings`/`conclusion` (two-way)
- ? Reported data in `header_and_findings`/`final_conclusion` (read-only after GetReportedReport)

---

## Conclusion

The dual-field architecture successfully separates:

1. **Reported Report** (`header_and_findings`, `final_conclusion`)
   - Original PACS data
   - Populated once by GetReportedReport
   - Not bound to any editor
   - Preserved for audit trail

2. **Current Editable Report** (`findings`, `conclusion`)
   - User's working draft
   - Bound to Findings/Conclusion editors
   - Continuously updated via two-way binding
   - Saved alongside original for comparison

This provides:
- ? Data integrity (original never overwritten)
- ? Audit trails (both versions preserved)
- ? Real-time editing (two-way binding maintained)
- ? Complete workflow support (capture ⊥ edit ⊥ save ⊥ compare)

The implementation is complete, builds successfully, and ready for testing! ??
