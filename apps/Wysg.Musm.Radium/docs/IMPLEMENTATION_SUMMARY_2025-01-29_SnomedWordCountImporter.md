# IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: SNOMED-CT Word Count Importer (2025-01-29)

## What Was Implemented
A new tool for importing SNOMED-CT concept synonyms into global phrases, filtered by word count. Accessible from Settings ¡æ Global Phrases tab via the "Import by Word Count" button.

## Files Created
1. **ViewModels/SnomedWordCountImporterViewModel.cs** (300+ lines)
   - Main ViewModel with candidate queue, pagination, and statistics tracking
   - Configurable domain and word count filtering
   - Add (active) and Ignore (inactive) phrase creation

2. **Views/SnomedWordCountImporterWindow.xaml** (200+ lines)
   - Modern UI with configuration panel, statistics display, and action buttons
   - Real-time status updates and progress tracking

3. **Views/SnomedWordCountImporterWindow.xaml.cs** (15 lines)
   - Simple code-behind with window initialization

4. **docs/FEATURE_2025-01-29_SnomedWordCountImporter.md**
   - Comprehensive feature documentation

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_2025-01-29_SnomedWordCountImporter.md** (this file)

## Files Modified
1. **Views/SettingsTabs/GlobalPhrasesSettingsTab.xaml**
   - Added "Import by Word Count" button in header section

2. **Views/SettingsTabs/GlobalPhrasesSettingsTab.xaml.cs**
   - Added `OnOpenWordCountImporterClick` event handler (40 lines)

## Key Features
- **Word Count Filtering**: Select 1-10 word synonyms from SNOMED concepts
- **Domain Selection**: Browse specific semantic tags (body structure, finding, etc.)
- **Dual Action**: Add as active OR ignore as inactive global phrase
- **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time counters for Added, Ignored, and Total
- **Intelligent Skipping**: Automatically skips existing global phrases
- **Efficient Pagination**: Pre-loads candidates in queue, fetches more as needed

## Technical Highlights
- Reuses existing Snowstorm API integration
- Leverages phrase service and SNOMED mapping infrastructure
- Queue-based candidate management for smooth UX
- Word count filtering on synonyms only (not FSN/PT)
- Proper phrase + concept caching + mapping in single transaction
- Refresh triggers in parent window after close

## Testing Status
- ? Build successful (no errors)
- ? Runtime testing pending (requires Snowstorm connection)

## User Experience
1. Click "Import by Word Count" button
2. Configure domain (e.g., "body structure") and word count (e.g., 1)
3. Click "Start Import"
4. Review each candidate term with concept info
5. Click "Add" (green) or "Ignore" (orange)
6. Watch statistics update in real-time
7. Continue until finished, then close

## Integration Points
- Uses existing `ISnowstormClient` for concept browsing
- Uses existing `IPhraseService` for phrase creation
- Uses existing `ISnomedMapService` for concept caching and mapping
- Integrates with GlobalPhrasesViewModel refresh mechanism
- Follows existing dark theme and styling patterns

## Notes
- Designed for systematic import of focused term sets (e.g., single-word body structures)
- Complements existing "Browse SNOMED CT" tool (which is for broader exploration)
- Inactive phrases serve as "seen/rejected" markers to avoid re-prompting
- Word count range (1-10) covers most practical use cases
