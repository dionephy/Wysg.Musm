In raidum, first, read the "plan.md", "spec.md", "tasks.md" in the "doc" folder.

My previously problems (PP):
1. Visible tabs exclusive -> solved
2. Mapping table updated with sequence/order -> solved, but needs upgrade

My new requests (do only what is implementable):
1. Add repository (Npgsql) in Radium
2. Wire the window VM
3. Hook entry points
4. Finish UI details

And please update the spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md files (add detail of my recent request; check the details that is done)
