In raidum, first, read the "plan.md", "spec.md", "tasks.md" in the "doc" folder.

My previously problems (PP):
1. Visible tabs exclusive -> solved
2. Mapping table updated with sequence/order -> solved, but needs upgrade

My new requests:
1. Add repository (Npgsql) in Radium
2. Wire the window VM
3. Hook entry points
4. Finish UI details

Before completing, please check for build errors.
And please update the spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md files per instructions in the template md files in the same folder (all three files must be very specific and must be cummulative).
